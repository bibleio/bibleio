Innovation for Christ. We focus on making better, free, open-source, modern Bible consumer tech for God's kingdom, preaching the gospel, and to help churches and communites.

This is the Bibleio monorepo, all the code that powers Bibleio. Here you can find our apps, websites, and back-end stuff.

# Structure

- [`apps/web-app`](https://github.com/bibleio/bibleio/tree/main/apps/web-app) Web app is a lightweight minimalist Bible study app, with all the Bibleio functionality.
- [`apps/website`](https://github.com/bibleio/bibleio/tree/main/apps/website) The main public facing website
- [`apps/docs`](https://github.com/bibleio/bibleio/tree/main/apps/docs) Developer docs
- [`apps/api`](https://github.com/bibleio/bibleio/tree/main/apps/api) Our back-end API, right now mainly a Bible API
- [`packages/design`](https://github.com/bibleio/bibleio/tree/main/packages/design) Our design system

## Developing

We use Turborepo and pnpm for our monorepo. Here's our main commands:
```bash
pnpm web-app:dev # web app dev server
pnpm site:dev # website dev server
pnpm docs:dev # docs site dev server
pnpm storybook:dev # design system storybook dev server
pnpm fix # format & lint all files, with biome
```
We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for formatting and linting, please use this when developing, or [setup your editor to use Biome](https://biomejs.dev/guides/editors/first-party-extensions/).

# Status

Right now we are in pre-alpha. We are working on all the vital components to get a Bible web app up and running with our own API and design system. We are also working on [BibleJSON](https://github.com/bibleio/biblejson), a universal formatting standard for scripture, so we can use that in our Bible API.

Once we get back-end functionality working, we will start rewriting the web app, as the current version was written in April 2024, and is very outdated. Then we'll start working on the Mobile and Desktop app with Tauri.

# Contributing

We'd love to have you contribute, currently Bibleio is a 1 person project. We have [huge ambitous goals](https://www.bibleio.com/roadmap), and having God's kingdom or anyone else help would be such a blessing.
