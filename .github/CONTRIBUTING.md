# Contributing

Please follow our [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you think you can contribute meaningfully, that's awesome!

First, please consult us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7eVCyQ5GGb) or via some other community page. See if your idea is a good idea, and get feedback. (Not required for small bugfixes)

Then make a fork, and make meaningful, useful changes or bugfixes.

View developer docs for working in the monorepo in the [README](../README.md).

Once you think you're done, **please** format all your files and lint them, then fix any errors or warnings if there are any:
```bash
# will format & lint
pnpm fix
```

Then create a pull request, stating all the changes you made in detail, and once we review your PR and approve it, you're good to go.

If we reject your PR or ignore it, don't worry about it and don't get discouraged. We could be busy, that might be why. And we will try to provide feedback if we reject.
