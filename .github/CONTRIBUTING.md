# Contributing

If you think you can contribute meaningfully, that's awesome!

It's always great to consult us by commenting on a GitHub issue or in the Discord, and you can view developer docs for working in the monorepo in the [README](../README.md).

To contribute, make a fork, make your changes, and before you make a pull request, **please** format all your files and lint them, then fix any errors or warnings if there are any:

```bash
# will format & lint
pnpm fix
```

Then create a pull request, stating all the changes you made in detail, and once we review your PR and approve it, you're good to go.
