# Godly Code of Conduct

Though we are a Christian community, we accept everyone as we are meant to, commanded by God.

Romans 14:1 "Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on his opinions."

# Your Expected Behavior

Always remember, what would Jesus do or say?

## Be inclusive

No matter who anyone is, what they believe in, who they identify as, they are a human created in the image of God.

Treat others with respect, like how you want to be treated. Love your neighbor as yourself.

Romans 15:7 "Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring glory to God."

1 John 4:11 "Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another."

## Love God and others

God is the purpose of this project, love Him, and love others as He tells us to.

Matthew 22:37-39 "Jesus declared, "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'""

## Accept other views

Accept different views and suggestions when developing ideas, this will increase innovation and inclusivity.

Philippians 2:3-4 "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or empty pride, but in humility consider others more important than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others."

## Sharpen each other

Teach others how to get better at their skill, sharpen each other.

If someone fails as a task, teach them how to get better, without complaining.

Proverbs 27:17 "As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another."

1 Peter 4:9 "Show hospitality to one another without complaining."
