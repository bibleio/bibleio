# Godly Code of Conduct

# Your Expected Behavior

## Be inclusive

No matter who anyone is, what they believe in, who they identify as, they are a human created in the image of God.

Treat others with respect, like how you want to be treated. Love your neighbor as yourself.

## Love God and others

God is the purpose of this, love Him, and love others as He tells us to.

Matthew 22:37-39 "Jesus declared, "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'""

## Accept other views

Accept different views and suggestions when developing projects, ideas, etc.

Philippians 2:3-4 "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or empty pride, but in humility consider others more important than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others."
