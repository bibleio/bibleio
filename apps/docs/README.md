This is our developer site, with docs for our developer stuff, and a component playground preview for our design package.

It is built with [unPreview](https://github.com/K0Rhq/ui) and [unDocs](https://github.com/K0Rhq/ui) for the UI.

We are still building this website, it is not ready for contributing docs, but you can help build the website.

# Developing

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run docs dev
```

`pnpm run docs fix` to format and lint with Biome.
