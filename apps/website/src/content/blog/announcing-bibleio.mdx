Welcome to the new era of Bible technology! We're here to innovate in the Bible technology space by building better software. We want to empower disciples, leaders, pastors, and communities to serve Christ more effectively.

## What we focus on

Our focus is building modern and better Bible technology for everyone. We aim for highly polished products with an emphasis on design and performance. We want to give you the best workspace for serving God, allow you to customize that workspace, and enable you to freely share and use resources. All free & open-source.

### Bible resources

We also want to provide access to all the Bible resources you need. Unfortunately, copyright and paywalls make that impossible right now. We want to partner with organizations to freely provide Bible translations, devotionals, commentaries, worship music, and much more. Unlike the rest of the industry, we don't want to put paywalls and copyright restrictions on God's resources. See contact info below if you'd like to help.

We want to break down these walls and freely give you these resources. Just as Jesus said in **Matthew 10:8**:

> Freely you have received; freely give.

## Our status

We are currently in development, building the foundation, planning features, and growing our community. Expect to see alpha/beta versions of our Bible app in **late 2025**.

### Future plans

We want to expand into other areas of Bible ministry and technology, such as creating a collaborative Bible translation app, a sermon maker app, a studio app for churches to manage their online presence and livestreams, and a global community for people to use and share Bible resources. If you would like to help discuss features or app ideas, see our community info below.

### Partnership
