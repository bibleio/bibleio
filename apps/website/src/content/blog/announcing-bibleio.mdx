Welcome to the new era of Bible technology. We are here to innovate the industry of Bible technology, by building better software to empower disciples, leaders, pastors, communities to serve Christ.

### What we focus on

We focus on building modern Bible technology for everyone, that is design, performance, and privacy focused. We are obsessed with design, we want to give you the best workspace for you to serve God in. Performance is accessibility, Bibleio will not feel clunky or slow. And privacy is given to you and your workspace with God.

We want to give you all the resources to grow closer to God and allow others to. We want to work with partners to to give Bible translations, devotionals, commentaries, worship music, and so much more **freely**, as the industry has been putting paywalls, and copyright on God's resources.

We want to break down the walls and give these resources to you freely. Just as Jesus said in **Matthew 10:8**:

> Freely you have received; freely give.
