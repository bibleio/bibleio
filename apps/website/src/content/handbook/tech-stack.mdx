Here is our tech stack focusing on ease of use and performance.

### Front-end

For our apps, we use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and for websites, we use [Astro](https://astro.build/) + [React](https://react.dev/).

### Apps

For the mobile & desktop apps, we use [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) combined with our front-end stack. Tauri is performant, secure, and small, since it is powered by Rust.

### Design system

In our design package, we use React [Radix Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) for base components. For styling we use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

### Back-end

We use [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com) powered by [Bun](https://bun.sh), and [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com) for authentication.

### Deployments

We use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/) Pages and Workers to deploy our websites, web app, and API.

For anything that doesn’t really need to be fast, or isn’t once of our products (such as our analytics), we self host it with [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) on our own server.

### Miscellaneous

- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) as our code styler and linter
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as our package manager
- [Umami](https://umami.is/) for lightweight & privacy friendly analytics
