The web has come a long way in the past few years, innovating and optimizing technology. Why can’t Christian technology be a part of that? Bibleio is a Christian organization, building better, free and open source technology for followers of Christ, pastors, churches, communities, and the world.

## What we do

We focus on building modern Bible technology for everyone, that is design, performance, and privacy focused. Design is the face of your product, we should make sure it looks nice. Giving a beautiful workspace for people to get closer to God in is one of our focuses. We also focus on performance, giving a blazingly fast experience to all users, even people with lower end hardware and internet. Performance is accessibility. And lastly, we focus on privacy and freedom. You do what your want with Bibleio, and we’ll keep it all secure and private things private, plus we’ll always be 100% free and open source so you can have our trust. By focusing on these main ideas, we hope to bring you an amazing experience to study God’s word in, and in the future, other activities.

## Where we came from

This started as a simple idea to make a Bible app, as one of my side projects, when I recently became Christian. I got around to it, and I built a simple Bible web app. But I saw that I was not allowed to access major Bible translations, only big companies could. And I saw there was no other innovative Bible apps out there. I thought this industry needed to change, so I started putting way more effort into this project, more research, and now hopefully, by the will of God, we can innovate the industry of Bible technology for Christ.

## Where we are

We are still in the early development stages, with big ambitious plans. Come contribute by tackling some issues, or testing and making new ones! Here’s our [GitHub](https://github.com/bibleio/bibleio).
