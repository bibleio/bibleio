The Bibleio API is a multipurpose API for all things Bibleio, and the Bible.

Our main focus right now is the `/bible` endpoint, which will serve the Bible in many different translations and languages using BibleJSON.

We plan to begin working on this after we get the [BibleJSON](https://github.com/bibleio/biblejson) formatting standard and converter working.
