UI kit for Bibleio, including React components and Tailwind configuration with color styles.

Built with Radix Primitives, other accessible React primitives, and Tailwind CSS.

# Developing

Right now we use Storybook as our component playground but we plan to switch to our own solution, unPreview once it's ready.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm design dev
```

`pnpm design fix` to format and lint with Biome.

## Usage for own projects

We will not maintain the npm package anymore, if people express interest in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/7eVCyQ5GGb) or GitHub we will start publishing this again.

You can still use this if you want though without an npm package.
